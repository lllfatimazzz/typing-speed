# Typing Speed Calculator

A Python-based command-line Typing Speed Calculator that helps you measure your typing speed in *Words Per Minute (WPM)* and calculates the *accuracy* of your typing. The app selects a random text for you to type and then evaluates your performance.

## Features

- *Random Text Generation*: A random text is provided for the user to type.
- *Words Per Minute (WPM)* Calculation: Calculates how fast you type based on the total words typed and time taken.
- *Accuracy*: Checks how accurately you typed the given text by comparing it word-by-word.
- *Time Measurement*: Displays the total time taken to complete the typing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x must be installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    
## Usage

Upon running the script, you'll be presented with a random text to type. The application will time your input and calculate both your typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and the accuracy of your typing.


## How It Works

1. The app randomly selects a text from a list of predefined texts.
2. You start typing the displayed text and hit Enter when done.
3. The app calculates:
   - *WPM (Words Per Minute)*: The number of words you typed per minute.
   - *Accuracy*: The percentage of words that were typed correctly.

## Customization

If you'd like to customize the texts used in the typing test, simply edit the sample_texts list in the typing_speed_calculator.py file and add your own phrases or sentences.
